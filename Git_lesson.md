## Library Carpentry. Module Three: Git

**Notes: set up website before hand**

### Self-reporting

In addition to the skill level self-reporting you've been doing, now we've hit the half way point of Library Carpentry we'd like to know if you are feeling able to articulate ways in which what we've learnt thus far could be used in your daily practice. So for the next two minutes, please write *briefly* on a sticky note a scenario in which you imagine - that is, not necessarily right now but with a little practice - you or your team will be able to use what you've learnt thus far at work, in your libraries. And if you can't see an application, then tell us that!

### Intro 

#### what we will try to do 
**begin** to understand and use Git/Github. You will not be an expert by the end of the class. You will probably not even feel very comfortable using Git. This is okay. We want to make a start but, like any skill, using Git takes practice. 

#### be excellent to each other
* If you spot someone who is struggling with something and you think you know how to help, please give them a hand. Try not to do the task for them: instead explain the steps they need to take and *what* these steps will achieve. 

#### be patient with me and yourself
* This is a big group, with different levels of knowledge, different computer systems. 
* This isn't my full-time job (though if someone wants to pay me to play with computers all day I'd probably accept). I'll do my best to make this session useful. 
* This is your session. If you feel we are going too fast, then please put up a pink sticky. We can decide as a group what to cover. 


### Hour One
- What is Git. What is GitHub. Basic language. Doing the basics.
- *Lesson based on Software Carpentry, [Version Control with Git](https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice) ([Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/))*
- the problem? loose changes, collaboration, different versions?
- solution: Version control?

### What is Git? 

Git is a 'free and open source distributed version control system'. We probably know what free and open source means but we might be less sure about what a 'distributed version control system is'. One way to understand what Git and version control systems do is to look at the types of problems they are built to address. 

[PhD comics](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)

Many of us will have had an experience similar to this. We are working on an important piece of work and we attempt to maintain multiple versions of this document, all at different stages of completeness. 

Version control addresses this problem by recording the changes made to a file as we proceed. Each 'commit' we make is recorded and we can go back across a file or set of files and look at what changes have been made. 

Version control allow us to take this one step further. It not only records changes to a file one person is working on but allows multiple people to work on a file and record the changes *they* make. It is then possible to merge these multiple files into one. 

This method came about to help software developers work collaboratively on coding projects. With version control, groups did not have to wait for someone else to finish working, nor did they have compare changes manually (and laboriously). 

When we make 'commits', we record a range of metadata about that change. As librarians, we might already be inclined to think creating metadata is useful but an example of what information is recorded will illustrate why the information recorded by version control systems in particular is useful. 'Commits' record the time and date a commit was made. Although we can often see information about when we last edited or saved say, a Word document, this only shows us the most recent changes. When we make commits, we can record a message explaining what changes we have made. This makes it especially useful for collaborating. Rather than sending an email with a document with track changes and some comments, we can include all that information with the document itself. This makes it easy to get an overview of changes that have been made to a document by looking at a log of all the changes that have been made. 

### Why use version control?
At this point you might be wondering why there is any need for librarians to know about version control. You are likely to think this again anytime you get stuck with Git. Although Git doesn't have some of the same immediate applications as other software tools there are some good reasons for librarians to get a better understanding of version control. 

* Research data management 
* Publishing 
* collaboration 
* Talking to tech people




### Git vs. GitHub vs. Gitlab

We often hear the terms Git and GitHub used interchangeably but they are slightly different things. Git refers to the software and principles used for a particular flavour of version control system, also called VCS in short (there are other systems such as Mercurial and SVN). GitHub is a popular site which hosts Git repositories. The majority of the content that GitHub hosts is open source software, though increasingly it is being used for other projects such as open access journals and constantly updated text books. GitHub is a great place to learn how to use Git but once you have learned the ideas and processes behind GitHub you can use Git on other storage systems. You can even host repositories on your own server if you want to keep your files private or if you wanted to encrypt your repository. You can get private repositories on GitHub for a fee. Gitlab is an open source Git repository management and hosting software. You can host it on your own server and configure with unlimited private repositories.

### Using Git 
One of the main barriers to getting started with Git is the language. Although some of the language used in Git is fairly self-explanatory, other terms are not so clear. The best way to get to learn Git language is by using it but having an overview of the language and the way Git is used will provide a good starting point. 

<!demonstrate Git commands whilst outlining what they mean>

### Some Git commands/language - what they mean and how to use them

**Repository** A repository is the place where are projects and associated changes are stored. Repositories can contain one single readme file or hundreds of different folders making up the source code for extensive projects. We can create repositories in a number of different ways; we can make our own from scratch, we can fork (copy) an existing repository or we can create a Git repository from an existing folder we have been working on. 

**init** Create a repository 

Whenever we use Git on the command line, we need to preface our command with `git`. This is so the computer knows we are trying to get Git to do something rather than another program. 

To try out some of the Git commands, we can make a repository for today's session. We can either delete this directory later or keep it as a place to test out new Git commands.

We covered the command line last week but we will go over them again. <!explain commands as we go along>

~~~
$ mkdir git_test
$ cd git_test
$ git init
~~~

**Git status**
we can use `git status` at any time to let us know what git is up to. 

if we try it now we should get something like this
~~~
$ On branch master
$ Initial commit
$ nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
~~~

This is telling us that we are on the master branch (more on this later) and that we have nothing to commit (nothing to save changes from). 
If we use list directory we can see currently we don't have any files to track. Let's change that by adding a txt file. Touch allows us to create an empty file.

~~~ 
$ ls 
$ touch git_test.txt
~~~

We now have a txt file. If we try `git status` again, we will get the following

~~~
$ git status
On branch master 
Initial commit
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

    git_test.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~

This status is Git telling us that it has noticed a new file in our directory that we currently aren't tracking. 

To change this, and to tell Git we want to track any changes we make to git_test.txt, we use `git add`

~~~ 
$ git add git_test.txt
~~~

This adds our txt file to the **staging area** (the area where Git checks for file changes). Because we are not alerted that this has happened, we might want to use `git status` again.

~~~
$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

    new file:   git_test.txt
~~~

We can see that the file has changed colour (generally from red to green) and Git also tells us that it has got a new file. 

Let's make some changes to this file before we commit it:
If you are on Linux or Mac use nano.
~~~
$ nano git_test.txt
~~~
On Windows open the file in Notepad++.

We should now be able to add some text to our text file. For now let's just write 'hello world'. If we try `git status` again. We should get the following message

~~~
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   git_test.txt
~~~

This lets us know that Git has spotted changes to our txt file but that it hasn't yet 'staged' them. This means Git won't currently record the changes we made. We can add the file to the staging area again

~~~ 
git add git_test.txt
~~~

We can now **commit** our first changes. Commit is similar to 'saving' a file to Git. However compared to saving, a lot more information about the changes we made is recorded and visible to us later. 

~~~
git commit -m 'hello world'
[master (root-commit) 27c3f19] hello world
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 git_test.txt
~~~

We can see that one file changed and we made one insertion which was our 'hello world'. We have now recorded our changes and we can later go back and see when we made changes to our file and decided to add 'hello world'. We do have a problem now though. At the moment our changes are only recorded on our computer. At the moment, if we wanted to work with someone else, they would have no way of seeing what we've done. Let's fix that. Let's jump to the GitHub website where we could decide to host some of work. Hosting here will allow us to share our work with our friend and collegues but will also allow other people to use or build on our work.

***

When we have logged in to GitHub, we will see an option to create a new repository. Let's make one for the GitHub experiments we are going to do today. 

* new repository 
* give it a name

GitHub will ask you to create README.md and add a license. Do not do it for now.
Once we have made our repository we still need to link the repository we have on our computer and the one we've just made. 

~~~
$ git remote add origin <name of your repo.git>
~~~

This will add a repository on github for our changes to be committed to. 
~~~
$ git push -u origin master
~~~

**git push** will add changes to our repository. The name of our remote is origin and the default local branch name is master. The -u tells Git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run `git push` and Git will know what to do. Go ahead and push it!

When we type this command, we will see Git 'pushing' changes to GitHub. Because our file is very small, this won't take long but if we had made a lot of changes or are adding a very large repository we might have to wait a little longer. 
We can get to see where we're at with `git status`.
~~~
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working directory clean
~~~
This is letting us know where we are working (the master branch). We can also see that we have no changes to commit and everything is in order. 

We can use `git diff` to see changes we have made before making a commit. 
Let's add another line to our text file. 

~~~
$ open git_test.txt
$ git diff
diff --git a/git_test.txt b/git_test.txt
index 70c379b..1d55e1a 100644
--- a/git_test.txt
+++ b/git_test.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
-Hello world
\ No newline at end of file
+Hello world
+More changes to my first github file
\ No newline at end of file
~~~

We can see the changes we have made. 

1. The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix diff command comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2. The second line tells exactly which versions of the file Git is comparing; `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3. The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4. The remaining lines are the most interesting; they show us the actual differences and the lines on which they occur. In particular, the + markers in the first column show where we have added lines.

We can now commit these changes again 

~~~
$ git add git_test.txt
$ git commit -m 'second line of changes'
~~~

Say we are very forgetful and have already forgotten what we changes we have made. `git log` allows us to look at what we have been doing to our Git repository. 

~~~ 
$ git status
commit 40d3f7af25e19c06fa839a570d51e38fdb374e80
Author: davanstrien <email@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Oct 18 15:25:19 2015 +0100

    second line of changes

commit 27c3f19c3340d930234d592928b11b63403d0696
Author: davanstrien <email@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Oct 18 13:27:31 2015 +0100

    hello world
~~~

This shows us the two commits we have made and shows the messages we wrote. It is important that we try to use meaningful commit messages when we make changes. This is especially important when we are working with other people who might not be able to guess as easily what our short cryptic messages might refer too. 

We might get a lit bit lonely working away on our own and want to work with other people. Before we get to that, it is worth learning one more command. 

**git pull**

We can try to see how this works by making changes on the GitHub website and then 'pulling' them on to our computer. 

Let's go to our repository. We can see our txt file and make changes. However, you may have noticed only our first change is there. This is because we didn't push our last commit yet. This might seem like a mistake in design but it is often useful to make a lot of commits for small changes so you are able to make careful revisions later and you don't necessarily want to push all these changes one by one. 

Let's go back and push our changes

~~~ 
$ git push
~~~

now if we go back to our github repo we can see all our changes. Let's add an extra line of text and commit these changes. When we commit changes on GitHub itself we don't have to push these. 

Now let's get the third line on to our computer. 

~~~
$ git pull

 git_test.txt | 3 ++-
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
~~~

If we open our text file again 

~~~
$ open git_test.txt
~~~

we can see our new lines. 

When we begin collaborating on more complex projects, we may have to consider more aspects of Git functionality, but this should be a good start. In the second hour we can look more closely at collaborating and using GitHub pages.

### Hour Two
* First 20 minutes or so - reinforcing how Git works. 
  - Draw diagrams of things covered so far
  - express language in 'non Git' way. 

* Build on first hour and make pull requests to a GitHub pages site. @davanstrien Setup before hand. site will link to some repositories useful for librarians/dh. 
* examples of collobarative working on GitHub links
* forking a GitHub page. 

## Lets review 

It is likely that some things won't have stuck from the last hour. To try and reinforce how things work we can work in groups to develop diagrams to illustrate Git functions and language. This should make carrying out more complicated aspects of Git clearer in our heads. 

In groups:

* illustrate the concepts discussed in the first hour
* try and 'draw' what different commands mean
* try and come up with synonyms for what the commands are doing. 

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages are websites hosted on GitHub. They allow you to build a repository that displays as a website. GitHub pages uses Jekyll, a 'blog aware static site generator' to turn a site of files and folders into a website.

### Why GitHub pages are awesome!

GitHub pages allow you to version control your website. This is useful for a lot different reasons. It allows you to keep a record of what changes you have made. It allows people to reference your website at a particular point in time and (if you make you're source open) to see what it was like at that particular point in time. This is very useful for academic citations. Most people have had the experience of following up a reference to a website and either getting a 404 error or seeing something completely different. Although using version on your site doesn't guarantee this won't happen it does make it easier to manage old versions of your site. 

GitHub pages also mean that you can collaborate on a website with a lot of people without everyone having to communicate back and forwards about what changes need to be made, or have been made already. You can create 'issues' (things that need fixing), list things to do in the future and allow other people visiting your website to quickly suggest, and help implement changes through pull requests. 

### Setting up a GitHub page 
Now we're all persuaded of how awesome GitHub pages are (or you've identified some fatal flaws in my reasoning) it would be useful to try playing around with some things we can do with GitHub pages. This will help us cement what we have learned in the previous hour and may help spark discussion for the last section of this session.

Suggestion for second hour. 
Use GitHub page generator to set up a GitHub page site.
* clone repo (add instructions)
* add other users (perhaps start with teams of two)
* in Groups make sure everyone tries committing - pulling changes to their computer 
* demonstrate how pull requests can be discussed. 
* guidelines handout 
* step by step 

### Hour Three
- Reflecting on what GitHub could be used for in local library setting. Free time to exploring more Software Carpentry lessons and adapting forked repo with suggestions for future Library Carpentry
- Helping each other out. 

user contribution to collections?
- editing of resources?
- crowd sourcing - could be an issue?
- making pull requests. 
- open access journals
